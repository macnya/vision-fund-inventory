// GET /activity — one trail of everything anybody has done.
//
// WHY MERGED RATHER THAN A SCAN LOG
// scan_log answers "what happened to assets". Accountability needs "who did
// what" — and that includes the approvals and refusals, which live in
// asset_verification and custody_request rather than in the scan log. An
// auditor asking "who approved that transfer?" gets no answer from movements
// alone.
//
// Five sources, one shape, ordered by time. UNION ALL rather than five separate
// requests so the page can paginate a single ordered list; a client merging
// five paginated feeds would have to over-fetch each one to be sure it had the
// next row.
