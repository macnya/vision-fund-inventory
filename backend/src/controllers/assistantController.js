// WHY THIS LIVES IN THE BACKEND
// The Slack bot answered the same questions with its own copy of the queries,
// its own scope handling and its own way of working out who was asking. Adding
// a third copy for the admin panel and a fourth for the scanner is how a system
// starts contradicting itself — which is exactly what happened to asset.status
// and the custody records.
//
// Here, verifyToken has already established who the caller is, what role they
// hold and which branch they are scoped to. The assistant inherits all of it.
//
// THE MODEL NEVER TOUCHES THE DATABASE. It receives the result of a query and
// turns it into a sentence. It cannot write SQL, cannot choose a table, and
// cannot see anything the caller's own role would not already show them. A
// prompt-injection attempt reaches a summariser, not a query planner.

// Constructed lazily. The SDK throws if the key is missing, and doing that at
// module load took the ENTIRE backend down — the register stopped serving 2,311
// assets because an optional assistant had no credential. One endpoint
// returning a clear error is the right failure mode; the API falling over is
// not.
